Stanford_CS106_Project
This program is the capstone project of the 2021 Code in Place course. It shows a window to load an image and display several buttons to applied filters to it. The user interface was developed with library PySimpleGUI and image processing with Pillow functions.

The idea to develop this app was triggered by the examples and assignment of the image process lecture using the educational Stanford library SimpleImage. For this project as the user interface PySimpleGUI integrated better with Pillow, I chose the last one for image filtering.

Thanks to Chris Piech, Mehran Sahami, Julie Zelenski and over 1,100 section leaders for they dedication and time supporting learners worldwide.
