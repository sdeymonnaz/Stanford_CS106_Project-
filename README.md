# Stanford_CS106_Projects
This folder contains the projects developed for the 2021 Code in Place course. 

The Image viewer app loads an image and displays several buttons to apply filters to it. The user interface was developed with library PySimpleGUI and image processing with Pillow functions. The idea to develop this app was triggered by the examples and assignment of the image process lecture using the educational Stanford library SimpleImage. For this project as the user interface PySimpleGUI integrated better with Pillow, I chose the last one for image filtering.

The second program was inspired by the cities plot using CSV files from the Files lecture. The course data was combined with a GeoPandas dataframe and some functionalities added to the program including a geo game.

Thanks to Chris Piech, Mehran Sahami, Julie Zelenski and over 1,100 section leaders for they dedication and time supporting learners worldwide.
